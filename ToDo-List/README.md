# Todo List
The objective of this project was to create something using jQuery instead of DOM manipulation.  
This project uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery/javascript to create a nice looking to-do list in which you can add/remove items as well as cross out items. 

# Instructions
When downloading, make sure the file structure is the same as it includes the jQuery file as well as links to font-awesome and google fonts.
