# Color Game Readme
The objective of this project was to create a game that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript using DOM manipulation.

# Purpose
You will have to guess a random rgb color presented on the screen from 6 different colored squares (3 squares if on easy).
When guessed right, the display changes and you may play again.  

# Instructions
As long as the files are all in the same folder, the HTML should work fine.  Have only tested on Google Chrome.
